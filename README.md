## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open Autodesk Fusion.
3. Go to `Utilities > Scripts and Add-Ins`.
4. Click `+`.
5. Choose `Script or add-in from device`.
6. Select the add-in folder.
7. Open the **Add-Ins** tab.
8. Select **Bambu Lab Filaments**.
9. Click **Run**.

## Usage

1. Select a face, body, or component.
2. Choose the application level in the panel.
3. Search for a filament.
4. Click its color.

Created appearances use names like:

```text
Bambu Native | PLA Basic | Red | #C12E1F
```

## Application level

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Face(s) | Applies only to selected faces |
| Body / object | Applies to the selected body |
| Entire component | Applies to all bodies in the component |
| Entire selection | Applies to all selected items |
| Entire visible model | Applies to all visible bodies |

## Keyboard shortcut

The add-in creates a Fusion command named `Bambu Lab Filaments`.

You can assign a shortcut to it, for example `⌘B` on macOS.

> The Fusion API does not allow the add-in to set the shortcut automatically.

## Native Autodesk appearances

The add-in finds a compatible appearance in the Autodesk library, copies it into the design with `addByCopy()`, then updates its color.

This approach aims for better compatibility with Fusion’s native behavior.

## Translucency

Translucent product lines have a dedicated preview in the panel.

Examples:
- PLA Translucent
- PETG Translucent
- PC Transparent

## Export

The panel offers:

### Fusion Archive
```text
Project_PARENT.f3d
```

### 3MF
```text
Project_PARENT.3mf
```

The root component is exported as a single 3MF file using Fusion’s native exporter.

## About STL

STL is fine for geometry meshes, but not reliable for appearances and colors.

Prefer `.3mf` or `.f3d` to keep more model information.

## Catalog

Data lives in `bambulab_full_catalog.json`.

Example:

```json
{
  "manufacturer": "Bambu Lab",
  "category": "PLA",
  "material": "PLA Basic",
  "color_name": "Red",
  "hex": "#C12E1F",
  "finish": "standard",
  "translucent": false
}
```

Some entries have an exact HEX value; others use a visual approximation when no reliable public value was available.

## Compatibility

- macOS
- Windows
- Autodesk Fusion with Python API
